## A Sample React Todo App

#### To run the project

clone or download the repo
`git clone https://github.com/filipnathanel/react-todo`

enter the directory
`cd .\react-todo\`

install the project
`npm run setup`

run the dev environment
`npm run start`

visit http://localhost:3000 on Chrome

The app logic will work on other browser but the styling is a bit off.

Cheers!
